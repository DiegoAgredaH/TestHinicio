# :zap: Full Stack Test - Energy System

This project has been developed using a combination of modern technologies to provide a great user experience. Vite has been employed as the development environment, ReactJS for building interactive components, Typescript to ensure a more secure and efficient codebase, and the Tailwind CSS style framework for elegant and responsive design.

Additionally, the reusable component collection from ShadCN has been leveraged to efficiently construct the user interface, enabling us to streamline the development process and maintain visual consistency throughout the project.
